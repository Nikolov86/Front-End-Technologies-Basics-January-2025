        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Semantic HTML is the backbone of modern web development. It provides
          meaning to the web content, making it accessible and easier to
          maintain.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Use Semantic HTML?</h2>
        <p>
          Using semantic HTML helps search engines better understand your
          content, improves accessibility, and enhances the overall structure of
          your web pages.
        </p>

        <h2>Example of Semantic Tags</h2>
        <p>Here is an example of a semantic structure for a blog post:</p>
        <img
          src="semantic-html-example.png"
          alt="An example image showing semantic HTML structure"
        />

        <blockquote>
          "Semantic HTML is not just about coding, it's about creating
          meaningful connections between content and context." â€” Unknown
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Adopting semantic HTML can elevate your web development practices and
          create better experiences for users and developers alike.
